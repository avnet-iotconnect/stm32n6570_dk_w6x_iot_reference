# Software Components

This firmware stack is built on a focused set of core components.

## Core Stack

- FreeRTOS kernel
- LwIP network stack
- MbedTLS TLS/crypto library
- PKCS#11 object interface
- Command Line Interface (CLI)

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI is used for runtime setup, provisioning, and diagnostics.

See:

- `Appli/Common/cli/ReadMe.md`

## PkiObject API

The PkiObject layer handles representation/conversion of certificates and keys used by TLS and provisioning flows.

See:

- `Appli/Common/crypto/ReadMe.md`

## Security and Storage Architecture

PKCS#11 and KVS are intentionally separated:

- PKCS#11: cryptographic objects (device key/certificates, CA certificates)
- KVS: runtime configuration (MQTT endpoint/port, Wi-Fi credentials, thing name)
